# "I have constant headaches from Docker Desktop with regular regressions each update. How is the stability of Podman when it comes to day-to-day work and Docker compatibility? For example I wonâ€™t be able to switch away from the Docker engine on our AWS EC2:s, but I might be able to try Podman locally if it can output fully compatible images.",1
# "How good is it for Kubernetes cluster administration? I'm used to using kubectl and I don't know if I am losing something with a Gui like this or lens.",1
# "You can apply YAML, edit, as well as delete any artifacts (pods, services, ingresses, etc.).  It helps create a more visual approach similar to k9s / Lens in a more integrated area (you can see your local containers too through Podman Desktop)",1
